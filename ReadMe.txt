Metaversian Republic is a Third Person Corn Shooter game built by the Universe XYZ DAO and funded by the original Polymorph sales.

After the Polymorphs original mint, funding went to building out a cohesive and tech first universe for Polymorph holders to enjoy, 
including: 

- Polymorphic Therapy (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf-6ele4-Co)
- Burn to Mint Polymorphs V2 (https://polymorphs.universe.xyz/)
- Polymorphic Faces (https://opensea.io/collection/polymorphic-faces)
- Metaversian Republic Game (https://apps.apple.com/bg/app/metaversian-republic/id1633691328)
- Deviants (https://metaversia.universe.xyz/)

Universe XYZ DAO invites everyone to contribute, improve, and add to the game's source code and files. Due to the size of the project,
we are unable to use GitHub as the storage solution for the game. Instead, Universe asks that any pull request contain a link to a 
google drive or dropbox folder containing the Unreal Project source files. While we understand that this is not a perfect solution,
Universe will modify its procedure for accepting pull requests as better Open Source code solutions become available for handling large code repositories.

Currently, Metaversian Republic is only available on the iOS app store. There is a blocker for play store upload for Android that the 
developers working on this project could not get around. The TLDR: Play Store APK requirements are not supported by Unreal Engine at the 
moment.
